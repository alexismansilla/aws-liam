# Welcome to Liam Gem!

Liam is an integration between your rails app & SNS, SQS AWS Services. It allows sending a message to the AWS queue (SQS) and processes the topic name on other rails app. (microservices)

we name the gem Liam in honor to (Liam Neeson) for so many reasons!

Liam sends an important message to Marko from Tropoja

> *I dont know who you are, i donâ€™t know what you want, but i will find youm and i will kill you*

We have a medium post [Here](https://medium.com/archdaily-on-technology/microservices-events-aws-our-path-to-improve-communication-between-our-ruby-on-rails-apps-501b65e35fa3) where we improve communication between our Rails apps and avoided create new endpoints in our apps.
BUT What's happening when the App A needs data of App B and App B is down for a microsecond?
